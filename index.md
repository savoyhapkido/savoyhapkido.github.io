## Hapkido: The Way of Cordinated Power

Three basic principles of Hapkido:


1. Circular Motion 
The way a circle is used to move an attacker off balance. The same circular motion is used to gain speed and force to take that attacker to the ground
 

2. Non-Resistance 
The way an attacker’s own force can be used against himself (do not meet force with force). The way one uses minimal resistance and counterforce to defend oneself from an attacker.
 

3. Water Principle
The way one flows around an attacker (like water around a rock) and counterattacks at the attacker’s weaknesses.

## About Us

Hapkido techniques use the principles of non-resistance, circular motion, and water for self defense. No previous martial arts experience or athletic ability is necessary.

Hapkido is one of the best martial arts for practical self-defense. We do not prepare for sporting tournaments; we do not memorize elaborate forms; all we do is practice ways to escape from, throw, ground-fight, choke, kick, punch, joint-lock or otherwise finish an attacker.
