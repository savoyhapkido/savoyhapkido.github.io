## About Us

Hapkido techniques use the principal of non-resistance, circular motion, and the water principal for self defense. No previous martial arts experience or athletic ability is necessary.

Hapkido is one of the best martial arts for practical self-defense. We do not prepare for sporting tournaments; we do not memorize elaborate forms; all we do is practice ways to escape from, throw, ground-fight, choke, kick, punch, joint-lock or otherwise finish an attacker.
